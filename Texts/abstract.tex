The single-particle temperature Green's function of the Fröhlich polaron is simulated at zero temperature using three different types of diagrammatic Monte Carlo schemes. Using bare schemes both the Green's function and the corresponding proper self-energy are simulated. The Green's function obtained through Dyson equation from the proper self-energy is then observed to be consistent with the directly simulated Green's function. A bold-line scheme simulation is also carried out, the results of which are in close agreement with what was obtained from the bare scheme simulations. Complications due to noise prone statistics are discussed and an improvement is suggested. Finally the ground state energy $ E_0 $ and the $ Z_0 $-factor of the polaron are extracted through the asymptotic behavior of the Green's function.
