\section*{Units}

Throughout this text $ k_\text{B} = \hbar = 1 $ has been used. With this notation there is no difference between wave vectors and momentum, which is the reason to they sometimes being used interchangeably.

\section*{Definitions}

At a few instances the symbol $ \dotDelta $ appears. This is an invented shorthand notation defined as $ \dotDelta x \equiv \Delta x / 2 $ used to make certain expressions appear less cluttered.
